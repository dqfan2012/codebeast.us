    <h1 class="cover-heading">Welcome to Codebeast.us</h1>
    <p class="lead">Codebeast.us is a project I started in 2012. It has been in "development" since then, but I was never serious about getting it done. All that has changed. My website is in active development now.</p>
    <p class="lead">This site will contain both my resume and portfolio. Please keep returning to see the new updates.</p>
